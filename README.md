# Go_saz

This project is a simplified implementation of the Shazam audio fingerprinting algorithm in Go.

## Features

- **Audio Fingerprinting**: Extracts unique hashes from audio samples for quick lookup.
- **Spectrogram Generation**: Converts audio signals into a time-frequency representation.
- **Peak Detection**: Identifies significant points in the spectrogram for robust matching.
- **Database Matching**: Compares extracted fingerprints against a database to recognize audio.
- **Go Implementation**: Uses idiomatic Go and best practices for efficient processing.

## How It Works

1.  **Preprocessing**: The audio file is converted into a spectrogram.
2.  **Peak Extraction**: Unique peak points are identified in the spectrogram.
3.  **Fingerprinting**: Hashes are generated from peak pairs.
4.  **Storage & Matching**: Hashes are stored and compared for identification.
5.  **Recognition**: The system returns the best-matching audio file from the database.

## Installation

```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/shazam-go
cd shazam-go
go mod tidy

```

## Dependencies

- Go
- PortAudio (for audio processing)
- go-audio/wav (for reading wv file)
- A database (e.g., PostgreSQL, SQLite) for fingerprint storage

## Future Enhancements

- **Noise Reduction**: Improve robustness against background noise.
- **Real-time Recognition**: Implement streaming audio recognition.
- **Distributed Processing**: Optimize for large-scale audio databases.
